# NOTE : The purpose of this program is to merge all of the css files into a single stylesheet file.
# This is done so that the amount of requests that browsers must make is lowered.
# This helps improve load times even when merging into a single large css file.

# TODO : In the future, simplify the files themselves by parsing them and getting rid of all
# non-significant whitespace, so as to reduce the amount of bytes sent through the network.
